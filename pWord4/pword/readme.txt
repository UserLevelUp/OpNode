This is what I want to do.

At the treeview selected node thing when I go into the event mousedown... I want to save the last node selected.

And I want to fix up the way the mouse selects the correct treeview.  Right now the logic is slightly off.

12/6/2010 16:39 PM  fixed the notify icon.  The notifyIcon1 double click event was written incorrectly because it used the ShowDialog command instead of performing the correct list of actions.

12/6/2010 17:00 PM Now I want to enhance the pWord registry section and get it working correctly.

12/11/2010 19:41 PM Now I'm planning on adding a suffix as of this moment.  Copyright 2010...   The standard appears to have a prefix, however, it doesn't really justify a suffix in its documentation for 
xml.   What I want is a suffix.  A suffix is like a prefix, except its on the ending of the tag tag.  It's basically saying that its my derivative implementation of a standard, with some added stuff.

Here is a simple implementation.  Notice that the thing that xhtml would never be able to figure out is my actual implementation.  The idea here is to have my own implementation or derivative of an 
original standard, but be able to tell a standard where I veer off course.  So pWord will be implementing suffixes as a way of giving people the opportunity to distiguish their derivative work from a known schema.
Notice that the tag goes in between the colons.
