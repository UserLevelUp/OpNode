This is what I want to do.

At the treeview selected node thing when I go into the event mousedown... I want to save the last node selected.

And I want to fix up the way the mouse selects the correct treeview.  Right now the logic is slightly off.

12/6/2010 16:39 PM  fixed the notify icon.  The notifyIcon1 double click event was written incorrectly because it used the ShowDialog command instead of performing the correct list of actions.
